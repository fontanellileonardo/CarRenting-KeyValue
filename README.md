# Car Renting Application
This repository contains a JAVA application for the Large Scale and MultiStructured Databases course.
It's the same application of the former repository [CarRenting](https://github.com/fontanellileonardo/CarRenting), with the difference that in this one it has been implemented also a Key-Value database exploiting the Riak's database functionalities.

## Requirements
In addition of the requirements of the former application, it has been asked to perform a feasability study on the possibility of translating the data model (even just a part of it) to a key-value model and also an implementation of it.
